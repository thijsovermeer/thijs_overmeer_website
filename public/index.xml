      <description>As a full-time employee at EAISI (Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence Systems Institute), I have the opportunity to work on a wide range of artificial intelligence (AI) projects and collaborate with industry partners. Located at the Technical University of Eindhoven, EAISI is a hub for AI research and development, and I am constantly learning and growing as a result of my work here.
One of the most exciting aspects of my job is the opportunity to work on a variety of AI application areas.</description>

      <description>As a data scientist and avid football fan, I was thrilled when I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) on a project for my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis. The goal of the project was to quantify the danger at a certain point in time in a football match using event and tracking data.
To accomplish this, we used two main data sources: event data and tracking data.</description>

      <description>As I entered my fourth and final semester at the JADS university, I was excited to complete my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis and graduate with a degree in data science. In addition to my thesis, I also had the opportunity to take two additional courses that rounded out my education in data science.
One of these courses was Data visualization, in which I learned about the various techniques and tools used to create effective visualizations of data.</description>

      <description>As I began my third semester at the JADS university, I was excited to dive into my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis and tackle a real-world problem alongside the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB). In addition to my thesis, I also had the opportunity to take four other courses that complemented my studies in data science.
One of these courses was Cybersecurity, in which I learned about the various threats to digital systems and how to protect against them.</description>

      <title>Part time job at BAS Trucks</title>

      <description>From my first project, I managed to land a part time job at BAS Trucks. In this job I created models that can help BAS Trucks predict which vehicles will be sold to which country and for what price. Additionally I performed several other tasks that were confidential for BAS Trucks.</description>

      <title>Courses during semester 2 of the JADS master</title>

      <description>In the second semester at JADS, I followed 5 courses. The courses differed a lot. Some of them I liked more than other which is also reflected in the results I achieved for these subjects. In the next few sentences I will describe all of the subjects in short together with the results I achieved.
Interactive and Explainable AI desgin; This course focussed on making models that are produced by algorithms more interpretable.</description>

      <title>New programming language, OOP and design patterns. </title>

      <description>This project was pretty big, as I wanted to get better at programming. Luckily, my brother could help me out as he has a degree in computer science. From him, I got the suggestion to start learning about TypeScript, object-oriented programming and design patterns to become a better programmer. As I wanted to get a good understanding, I decided to get the book TypeScript quickly as it gives an introduction to TypeScript and its accompanying frameworks, like angular and react.</description>

      <description>Building a notebook in which different algorithms are used to predict the housing prices based on a dataset from Kaggle. I used both a random forest model and a keras neural network. In the end, the random forest model worked significantly better than the neural network. This project was aimed to increase my skills in building regression models as I had not done this before. With the help of example Kaggle notebooks, I learned a lot from this project.</description>

      <title>Building a convolutional network to classify images.</title>

      <description>I build a convolutional neural network, that could classify images into 10 different classes. The thing that I am most proud of is that I managed to visualize the parts where the neural network paid attention to. This can be seen in the next picture.
  The parts that are red are the parts where the convolutional layer paid attention to. The following code was used for this implementation</description>

      <title>BAS Trucks</title>

      <description>In the first semester, while studying at JADS, we made a dashboard for BAS trucks, which could predict in which certain vehicles were going to be sold. Also using an API, we created a dashboard for BAS Trucks where it could specify vehicle characteristics and based on this the model would predict how likely a vehicle was going to be sold to a specific region.
Unfortunately, this project&amp;rsquo;s code included sensitive information, thus can not be included here.</description>
