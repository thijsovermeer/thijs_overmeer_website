      <description>In the first semester, while studying at JADS, we made a dashboard for BAS trucks, which could predict in which certain vehicles were going to be sold. Also using an API, we created a dashboard for BAS Trucks where it could specify vehicle characteristics and based on this the model would predict how likely a vehicle was going to be sold to a specific region.
Unfortunately, this project&amp;rsquo;s code included sensitive information, thus can not be included here.</description>
